Deploy an artifact with classifier

  Classifiers are the additional text given to describe an artifact.

+---+
  artifact-name-1.0-bin.jar
  artifact-name-1.0-dev.jar
  artifact-name-1.0-prod.jar
+---+

  From the above artifact names, classifiers can be located between the version and extension name of the artifact.

  *<<<bin>>> is used to describe that the artifact is a binary.

  *<<<dev>>> is used to describe that the artifact is for development.

  *<<<prod>>> is used to describe that the artifact is for production.

  []

  To add classifier into your artifact for your deployment, set the text to the <<classifier>> parameter.

mvn deploy:deploy-file -Durl=file:///C:/m2-repo \
                       -DrepositoryId=some.id \

                       -DpomFile=path-to-your-pom.xml \
